								<h3>What Are FHA Loans?</h3>
								<p className="pt-3">
									FHA stands for the Federal Housing Administration, a government agency that standardizes and insures
									home mortgages, which makes it easier for more people to get loans to purchase a home.
								</p>

								<h3 className="pt-4">FHA Loan Requirements</h3>
								<p className="pt-3">
									The FHA requires that homes with FHA-backed loans meet certain standards. The homes must also be
									appraised by an FHA-approved appraiser in order to qualify. FHA loans require that you pay an up
									front Mortgage Insurance premium of 1.75% of the loan amount. This may be paid at closing or rolled
									into the loan.
								</p>
								<p className="pt-3">In order to pay your down payment with gift funds, the gift give must meet certain FHA requirements.</p>

								<h3 className="pt-4">FHA Loan Limits</h3>
								<p className="pt-3">
									FHA loan limits vary by county, with loans in some counties financed for up to $679,650.
								</p>
